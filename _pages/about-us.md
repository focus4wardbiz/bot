The shop is an online market for art, the art we sell the intellectual property of some of the most creative artists in Africa. The BOT helps promoting artists' work by providing a platform for their work to be seen by our wide range of visitors and help them sell the art to our esteemed visitors.&nbsp;

Any&nbsp;type of art can be sold on the BOT by only the selected artists and any artist is free to apply to start selling their art on the BOT. The BOT benefits from arts sales through commissions on items sold.&nbsp;
