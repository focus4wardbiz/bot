<p>It's Almost Past Midnight Now ,And Sleep Isn't Coming <br>
The Day Is Over , everyone Is Gone And Am Left Dying All Alone <br>
I Feel Unwanted Everywhere , Even Through My Mirror I Can See A Broken Person <br>
Where Can I Go From Here And Find A Place That I Will Call Home<br>
The Pace I Set Is Finishing Me Slowly Through The Pain <br>
I Can't Find Peace And Sleep At The Same Time<br>
Memories Of My Failures  Keep Repeating In My Brain <br>
It's Like A Cassette Being Played Again And Again<br>
I Can Really See Myself Sinking ,Or Maybe Am Just Overthinking <br>
Or maybe I Worry More ,I should Worry Less<br>
Most Of My Life I Have Been Living Lifeless <br>
Times Past Without Me  Seeing Food On The Table<br>
Everything Was A Scramble ,A Struggle For Survival <br>
Putting Something For Digestion Was A Big Deal <br>
Now This Bed Time ,When Am Just On My Own I Can't Stop Looking Through The Past <br>
Flooded Is My Head With Thoughts Of No Prosperity<br>
I Cant See The Future Being Bright ,Because My Eyes Got To Much Dust <br>
Tomorrow  Comes to Me  Like A Surprise <br>
And Whatever I Do, I Do It With So Many Regrets <br>
Am Living In A World Of Sorrow WithThis Generation Of Forcing Standards</p>
