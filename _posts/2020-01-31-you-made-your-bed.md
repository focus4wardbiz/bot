<p>How shall we get out of this labyrinth? Misery and suffering is all we know, last year was tough, I saw my strongest friends break, one of my most jovial friends committed suicide, My girlfriend too wanted to throw herself under the bus she even posted a video left me a note and thank God I never got the chance to read it, I watched the happiest relationship get toxic, never lay a hand on a woman they said, never raise your voice to your man they said. Victims who became victors and that’s where we get the courage to tell the story behind our scars. We've been hurt so many times it stopped feeling a quarter as much pain, we've been betrayed by so many people we stopped getting surprised.<br> Most times we hope there will be a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/happy_ending">happy ending,</a> and we had to survive, we had to love. Love is a drug we got addicted to, we got in too deep and way too fast. I remember she used to place a cigarette at the left side of her ear as if a carpenter, and boy I loved her bravery. We both needed an end of this suffering and so we figured cigarettes were a ticket. Every puff was symbolic, a day less of the pain. We are living in an era where eighteen-year-olds have gone through so much trauma.<br> I remember a friend of mine told me a story of how her drank dad defiled her in front of her sick mom, her mom had paralysis later died out of shock and then her dad blamed her for the death of her mother. She was just a child. She is the most beautiful creature I've ever seen when she smiles she lightened up the room. She told me all she has left was her smile. She still affords it, she has to do it for her mom regardless of everything.</p>

<p><br> Coming to university a few years down the line, the same alcohol that led to our family falling apart was the same that I decided to indulge in. I wanted to know how getting high feels. I even got nicknamed Legend after the famously and affordable brandy. I saw my grades go down, I even reached a level I slept in bushes and yeah I didn’t get any stigma for that instead my friends would listen to the funny stories and say ‘way to go‘.I thought that it would help the pain go away. I thought it would give me answers that my parents never gave me. If you come from a broken home you’d understand. It hurts knowing that I was the only hope to my mom and younger siblings and yet all I do is drink, again nobody is perfect, I wanna change, I do <br> You wanna know how many relationships I've ruined due to alcoholism and yet every time I wanna believe that our relationship with God is still intact. How many more accidents have to happen for us to realize that the only high we needed was the most high God all puns intended.How many more broken marriages? How many more women are gonna get abused, how long are they going to go looking for their husbands in bars in the middle of the night, how many more girls need to be brought up by drunk mothers? who is gonna change this if not us? How much more money is gonna end up in the drains, how many more infections, how many more deaths? Yet we claim to be addicted teens at the age of twenty. The future is brighter without drugs, you don’t have to wait for the experience to teach you, choose God.</p>
