<p>I Chose To Be Bitten Twice . Yes ,I Might Be Strong But The
Pain Is Enough. I Have Surrendered The Ego Now Am Back To Life. I Think I Have
Missed You ,Especially Your Love. I Think I Need You The Most You're My
Side.&nbsp; Let Me Cry&nbsp; ,Wishing you Could See Me Even At A Glance.
My Dreams For Us Are High Above The Mountains And Over The Oceans . </p>

<p>Receive My Worth less Effort Dear You. Hope You Cant Forget What Was Between Us Two. Sorry For The Heartbreaks And The Bitter Days That Love Do . Wish You Could Rewind Moments ,Though You Gave Me Few. Tell Me What A Lone Man Can Do With A Broken Heart. Nothing Is Going To Last So  I Thought The love Wasn't Just For Lust . Remember What You Said And Promised , Let It Not Be Simple Words That You Lied. </p>

<p>I have been Thinking Of The Best Apology Still I  Can't Figure Out How I Can Escape The Chronology. I Hate The Fact That You're Colonising My Feelings Like You're A Brit. Tried To Change My Behavior But It Seems  Like It's Unseen . Am Sorry For Everything That Wasn't Nice ,I Couldn't Change It. Am Tired Of Loosing Status While You Know How I have Been . Am Almost Getting The Suicidal Thought Hoping  I Won't Sin. </p>

<p>Last Thing Before My Ink Fades. I Devoted Everything For You Yet You Ignored And&nbsp; Say We Can't Even Be&nbsp; Friends. I Have Been Shading&nbsp; Tears For You And My Eyes Don't Stop. I Came To Realize&nbsp; You Didn't Care&nbsp; Even A Little Bit. I Wanted You To Know, I Have Tried To Move But I Can't Make The First Step. </p>
