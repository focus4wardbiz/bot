<p>Before My Heart Stops <br> Before Everything Comes To Halt <br> After Then Everything Will Be Spoiled <br> Before My Time Ends, And My Whole Heart Bleed<br> Before Everything Is Poured Down On The Ground <br> I Know I will Still Be Broke And Broken, And Sad <br> When They See My Heart,  Cruised And Bruised <br> After Then They'll Treat Me Right <br> When They See The Scars I've Nursed,<br> I Pray That  They'll Feel The Pain On Their Chest <br> I See Time Elapsing and I Don't Want To Be Late <br> I See  Everyday As  Another Chance To Correct My Mistake <br> Trying To Put Everything I Fear In The Bucket <br> But Before Then, I Should Accept The Lessons <br> Learn Everyday To Cope-Up With Every Season<br> Learning To Let Go What Put Me In Prison <br> The Hate And The Ego, Aborted Like A Mission <br> And Before My Heart Stops, Everything Will Have Gone To Substitution </p>
