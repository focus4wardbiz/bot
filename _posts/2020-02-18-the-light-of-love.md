<p>Cheli first saw the beauty of the world in the lush evergreen highlands in Kericho. Peace and goodness reverberated from every corner, every person, every sunrise and every sunset. Her parents especially her father made sure she had everything she needed. Waking up to eat guavas and strawberries from their farm with her friends was something to look forward to. The funny lad with the loud belch was especially a thrill to be around with because not a moment passed without them laughing until their bellyached. It was a good life and she did not imagine it being any different.</p>

<p>It came a time when they moved to a place too different from what she was used to. Cheli was not too young to realize that times were tough. Running around a farm full of fruits would be no more. Her mother said that moving was for the better but Cheli knew her mother was lying. It became all clear now that her parents were not in good terms. The lavishness she had veiled her from actuality. Dear father had lost his job to the devil’s mouthwash; alcohol. Everything henceforth turned out for the worse. He never could keep a job. It all fell on her mother to cater to their needs.</p>

<p>To escape reality, Cheli studied hard. She agreed to transfer to boarding not because her mother said she needed her character molded but because she knew mama did not want her to grow up around an estranged father. Money was also short and boarding school came cheaper than the school she was going to. Cheli was not blind to the pain and struggles of her mother so she tried not to burden her by being troublesome. Her father was present yes but never there. He was not violent but that did not mean he hurt them any less. He was always out pub crawling with his friends who were ever half-seas-over as he was. He had not an ounce of care that he had a responsibility. Only liquid courage mattered. It was God’s grace that it went on for many years without him losing his health, family or his life.</p>

<p>Her father did have a mind turn one day and willingly decided to undergo rehabilitation. He either felt guilty that he was an absentee father or remorseful for he never felt any hatred but love and care from Cheli and his darling wife. It was true that she never hated her father.&nbsp; To her, he was her dad and her protector. Only that he needed saving from the prison he was in. She could not imagine her family without him so she prayed to God for him to change. Ten years down the line her father has been sober and she is proud of the man he is; a conqueror. He did not let his addiction control his life forever. </p>

<p>Through
her father’s eyes, she knows better than to let herself ever drown in alcohol
or any other vice. She knows alcoholism only brings pain and losses to those
who care.</p>

<p>Alcoholism is a disease. So many people have fallen as prey to its short-lived high only to drown in it without knowing how to bounce back. Like Cheli’s dad, all it takes sometimes is to show these people love and care so that they can find a purpose for their lives again and find it possible to break the chains of alcohol addiction. There are hope and love always prevails.</p>
