<p>Human need grew overtime to human greed, overlooking the beauty that they project (aesthetic value). Fact is, its not only us that’s dependent on them. Animals and birds are all mourning. A place called home, taken down,  not in small scale, but large scale.<br> Is it greed or need? </p>

<p>Interesting fact is, we are also directly affected; natural disasters (deaths we witness every year), carbon emissions and many more negative effects of deforestation. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> Don't we realize it? If we do, what's making us cut down more trees and not replace? Our actions are  from a single unit, “humanity" but the negative effects of these actions pose directly to several other units including us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> A question we could ask ourselves,  are we blinded by greed in the name of meeting our very own needs?<br> If it's greed that took over, how are we planning to handle the aftermath? Studies show, it gets worse with time. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> Assumption could be a point here, that probably the earth will heal itself and we will get away with it. How about the  phrase,  actions have consequences and in the long run, its us who are going to pay dearly. <br> Key to change is always connected to the mind. Needs are there,  we ought to meet them.  They are part of us, we cannot assume. How about we become more aware of every action we take and as we cut , we plant more? I don't want to call it laziness but this is practical.  It has been shared widely, still we do not implement. (That’s why assumption popped up earlier).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> If that’s another case scenario also, how about we be more aware of what's to come? More campaigns, more awareness,  more voices on this. If our eyes as humanity could be exposed to the aftermath day in and day out and made to realize that our generations to come are at risk, then maybe needs would be met with less greed.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br> At the end of the day it’s a brainstorm for us all to do.<br> Question is where are you going to start from as an individual?<br> Time to ponder and act immediately. <br> Our planet, our responsibility, our future.</p>
