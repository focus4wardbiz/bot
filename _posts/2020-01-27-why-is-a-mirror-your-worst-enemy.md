<p>The adolescent stage of my life was one I did not like or enjoy for that matter. And it all came down to one thing; ACNE. Transitioning from a smooth baby face to one riddled with mounds of acne and pimples was a blow to me. It was like my face had suddenly become an active volcano; Mt. Nyiragongo and the like. Any facial expression was accompanied by so much pain. It was actually hard to laugh because I used to think all the lava will come bubbling up the surface. And just when I thought that it was a passing phase, my sebaceous glands would start a revolution and my face would explode again. A trip to the dermatologist only resulted in me given painkillers and a word that by the time I reach my twenties, the acne would all disappear or reduce.</p>

<p>I had no option but to endure six more years of eruptions and unbalanced hormones. All this affected me in some way. I did not like the way I looked. It did not help that my peers and I were growing and that we started to realize we are different. Being attractive was something that mattered and to some folks, it meant being in particular groups or ‘cliques’ as they were called. It did not matter what they said actually. It was how they distanced themselves from you and how they did not include you in what they did. It was how you realized that no boy wants to be friends with you either because he will be the laughing stock or if he is talking to you it because he has been dared to do so as part of a silly joke. It was tough! I felt totally worthless and I thought that everything about me did not amount to any value. It not only affected my relationship with people but also my studies. All the compliments I received felt like mockery. They only made me angrier. I avoided anything that involved all the attention being drawn to me; be it answering questions in class or anything that needed expression of my opinions. I sometimes blamed myself for things that I now know I had no control over. </p>

<p>The thing about low self-esteem is that if it not checked, it becomes even worse as you grow. My low self-esteem was caused by just a matter of me transitioning from a girl to a young woman. Other factors that may contribute to low self-esteem include negative criticism from your parents and teachers as you were growing up, bad experiences from abusive relationships, financial troubles, chronic illnesses, physical and mental challenges and the things you constantly tell yourself. If you keep on feeding your mind with negative thoughts about yourself it will all roll down to low self-esteem.</p>

<p>Most of the factors that shape low self-esteem are uncontrollable. You can control what you think about yourself though. For me, it took being around a couple of good friends and I slowly began to view myself from another perspective. It also took a lot of self-talk by the mirror and telling myself that I am unique and beautiful just the way I am. That God created me the way he did and He did not make a mistake. What you think about yourself is really crucial if you want to have healthy self-esteem. &nbsp;How you think about yourself helps you react to whatever happens in your life. If you think positively then you will have a positive view of the world and vice versa. &nbsp;You do not have to please people in order to be liked, &nbsp;loved or respected. You need to stop comparing yourself with others. No human being is perfect. You have a right just as anyone else in this universe. The past is gone. Forget whatever happened and live for today. Embrace your achievements and accept the compliments. Do things that make you feel good and proud. It helps in boosting your self-esteem.</p>

<p>Building self-confidence is a work in progress but in the end, you will find that you are able to express your opinions with assertiveness and without fear of judgment. You will be confident in decision making. You will accept responsibility and more so you will be able to face new challenges without fear or anxiety. You will like, appreciate and respect who you are no matter your faults.</p>
