<p>Its Been Awhile Now Since The Rock Fell. I Have Always Prayed That The Wound Don't Swell. I Have Seen Things That Locked Me Up Like The Cell And Though I Still Stand Strong So Well.&nbsp; I Have Gone Through Trials And Confirmed How Life is So Cruel. Everyday Looks Like Finals, Sometimes I Wish I Would Put Myself For Sale. </p>

<p>Nowadays Happiness Is Like A Commodity. And For Me, I Don't Even  Have The  Ability To Find It. Success In Me Has Always Been A Scarcity Like Am Married To Poverty. The Stars I Was Aiming At, Have Already Lost, Being Poor Looks Like A Necessity. People Have Become Critics, So They Love Seeing Me In This Crisis. </p>

<p>We Say Real Men&nbsp; Don't Cry. That Even When We're Lone, Broke And Broken We Just Let The Pain Die. I Have Wanted To Be Such, But my Feelings Keep Rising High. Someone Tell Me How Worth Is&nbsp; Letting Go, I Want To Pay The Price. Sometimes I Have To Say No To A Place That Needed A Yes. I'm Struggling To Be Nice Hoping That One Day I Might Be Mentioned. </p>

<p>If This Is What Means By Life, Then I Need To Be&nbsp; Myself. I Won't Let My Eyes Watch The Light As It Dims. Let Me Sweat While It Shines And Rip My Harvest When It Rains. After All, There Are&nbsp; No Pains That Yield No Gains. The Dark Days Will Eventually Take A Halt As I Grow. The Bad Will Turn To Good Slowly While My Happiness Will&nbsp; Start To Flow.</p>
