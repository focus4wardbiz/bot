<p>Anyone
who has had a toothache knows how painful it is. The nights become long and
sleepless. You cannot eat well. Everyone seems to get on your nerves. You
cannot open your mouth fully to talk or laugh because once the cool air gets to
that cavity the pain that surges can almost make you drop down to the ground
unconscious. Painkillers can only work for so long. That is when you know you
have to go to the dentist and get that tooth pulled out. No talk of tooth
fillings or root canals. It just has to go. And then you make a pact with
yourself to limit your sugary food intake and to brush twice daily because the
instruments the dentist uses look scary and they give you the chills. Even
though you are numbed you can feel force they use to get that tooth off its
socket. It is not a good feeling. The whole ordeal is almost traumatizing. You
would never want to go back there ever. The relief after is such a joy though. You
feel alive again. </p>

<p>Just as we cannot overlook a toothache, is how we should not overlook our physical, mental and emotional health holistically. Self-care is about doing activities that replenish your soul, body, and mind rather than drain you. It about being balanced and feeling contented with your life. Point to note is that self-care is not a matter of being selfish. It is about giving attention to your needs. It is a matter of ensuring that a person you function at your optimal level.</p>

<p>The self-care practices mentioned do not work for every individual as every person is different. Figure out who you are and what you want as a person. It will then be easier to incorporate self-care in your daily regimen such that it becomes a habit. Self-care is an active choice. It is neither forced nor is it not a temporary band-aid. It might get difficult but in the long run, the pros outweigh the cons and you will come out a better, healthier and happier human being who is productive in every aspect of life.</p>
