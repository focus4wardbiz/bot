<p>They gave me a path that i should walk in, little did they know i wasn't tuned for that particular path.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A career choice is a long term investment. Key word, choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Decision making comes to mind. Let's be honest, at this point of our lives,  we rarely have a clue what to pick. Most of our choices result from external pressure which are majorly stereotypes. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It never really dawns on us that our entire future is depandant on the choice we make during this season. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When i think about the word career path, one word comes to mind, fulfilment. Are most people fullfilled in their choices?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I want us to juggle another word, passion. Are people linked to what they are passionate about? Initially we said its an investment. No one desires a loss during pursuit of a particular investment. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I truely believe the game needs to change, from structure to beliefs and norms when it comes to career.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How do you expect a mango tree to give you avocados and yet its a mango tree?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you cultivate it as a mango tree and tend to it with the required conditions, it will give an amazing produce and i believe that's the same with career choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's time we start investing in self realization for the young people so that when they are faced with the choice, it wont be so hard for them to navigate through.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What we dont realize is self realization for a particular individual is a powerful tool for change in our society and the world as a whole. It will not onlu benefit the individual,  but work put afterwards will come from a point of passiom hence powerful and positive impact. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We need to start thinking outside the box and ask ourselves why are we offering the courses we do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Is our future dependant on them? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The knowledge being pumped should be more of an asset than a liability.</p>
