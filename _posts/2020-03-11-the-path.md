<p>They gave me a path that i should walk in, little did they know i wasn't tuned for that particular path.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A career choice is a long term investment. Key word, choice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Decision making comes to mind. Let's be honest, at this point of our lives, we rarely have a clue what to pick. Most of our choices result from external pressure which are majorly stereotypes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It never really dawns on us that our entire future is dependant on the choice we make during this season.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When i think about the word career path, one word comes to mind, fulfillment. Are most people fulfilled in their choices?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I want us to juggle another word, passion. Are people linked to what they are passionate about? Initially we said its an investment. No one desires a loss during pursuit of a particular investment.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I truly believe the game needs to change, from structure to beliefs and norms when it comes to career.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How do you expect a mango tree to give you avocados and yet its a mango tree?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you cultivate it as a mango tree and tend to it with the required conditions, it will give an amazing produce and i believe that's the same with career choice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's time we start investing in self realization for the young people so that when they are faced with the choice, it wont be so hard for them to navigate through.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What we don't realize is self realization for a particular individual is a powerful tool for change in our society and the world as a whole. It will not only benefit the individual, but work put afterwards will come from a point of passion hence powerful and positive impact.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We need to start thinking outside the box and ask ourselves why are we offering the courses we do.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Is our future dependent on them?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The knowledge being pumped should be more of an asset than a liability.</p>
