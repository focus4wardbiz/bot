<p>Lifestyle describes a person's basic
character. &nbsp;Mahatma Gandhi once wrote that
Living a healthy life is
real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver. It is good health that brings us
the joy of enjoying the beauty of life. The positive part of having to live
healthily is that each person has the capability of controlling what goes on
inside their body which is quite the opposite while having to control the
external environment. It is, therefore, possible for us to take a step in
improving our health status. We decide what to eat which basically means at
times we are fault in case the food we eat negatively affects our health
status.</p>

<p>There
is a set of life patterns that can improve one's health. Such practices include
engaging in exercise programs, eating healthy foods and watching one's weight.
This are some core practices which helps in reducing risks of attaining diseases
such as cancer, diabetes, living in stress, high blood pressure including other
problems. Good healthy practices help in weight loss, maintaining strong teeth
and bones and improving one's memory and mood. Most people, however, find it
hard having to keep up with healthy living practices and hence end up at risks
of developing health problems, </p>

<p>If every person was responsible enough watched their daily routine then some of the common problem people go through would not be experienced. Waking up to healthy breakfast and some minutes of exercise would be the best way to start one’s day. It maybe tempting when hanging out with friends to keep yourself from buying junk food stuffs or on instances when out on shopping. Everyone should however keep in mind that starting from morning hours each decision we make may affect out bodies which serves as a reminder to keep watch of ones daily activities. Whether at home, workplace or when hanging up with our friends our choice of food should be highly watched.</p>

<p>It should be everyone's responsibility to ensure they are&nbsp;physically well, mentally stable, socially upright as well as being in a position of preventing infirmity or diseases. Being in a good condition and being happy is the best medicine as compared to any prescribed medicine from the doctors perspective. Nothing good comes easy. It only requires some little effort and wise decision making to watch out surrounding and food we choose to take. It’s all a matter of making a healthy living choice.</p>
