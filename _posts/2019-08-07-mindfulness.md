<p>As human beings, there comes a point in time where we feel
as if everything is just too much to handle. Subconsciously, the brain knows
that we need a break but as humans, we tend to let anxiety overwhelm us such
that we cannot take a step back and just breathe. We fail to understand that
being aware of our feelings can help us cope; that mindfulness helps us deal
with everyday pressures.</p>

<p>Mindfulness is more of a state of mind that it is a trait.
It is the ability to be aware of your thoughts, emotions, actions, and
reactions in the present moment without being judgmental both to yourself and
the people you relate with. Nobody is born perfect with this ability. As
children it was ingrained to us through various learning process yet that was
never enough. As adults, we embark the path of self-discovery and as much as
introverts are more aware of the present than extroverts, it takes a lot of
practice to incorporate mindfulness into daily life. The non-judgmental part of
mindfulness is what distinguishes it from meditation and it is what has made
this ability popular in the world of today as many have realized the importance
of achieving this state.</p>

<p>According to various psychological and clinical studies, it
is possible to train our minds to be focused on the present moment. To achieve
mindfulness is not as complicated. The ideas and concepts are familiar to those
who practice meditation. It just needs one to be in the moment; feel every
breath you take, feel the steps as you walk, listen to the rustle of trees and
the chirping of birds and watch the leaves fall. One can start by using the
aforementioned ways, before delving into the world of deep meditation. When one
has achieved a state of awareness, one can accept things as they are; whether
good or bad. One will also be able to detach from negative thoughts such as
anger and self-judgment. With mindfulness, you will be kinder and more patient
with yourself. You will hardly feel overwhelmed with life and the positive
mindset that comes with it will enable you to appreciate others and thus relate
well with others. You will view the world through new and wider perspectives
and be a happier and better person. Your health life will improve because of
reduced stress levels.</p>

<p>The journey to mindfulness is rejuvenating and the calmness that resonates with it is what we all need in this noisy planet. There is much going on in the world and being aware of your thoughts, feelings, and actions is what you might just need to live a better life. This path to clarity requires focus and the intent to remain so. The good thing is that it can be practiced anywhere. My hope is that everyone who is on this path may find the joy and peace he or she greatly desires.</p>
