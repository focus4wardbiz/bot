<p>Growing up
as a kid, life was as simple as it could be because I was fortunate to live
under the shadow of my parents. All I had to worry about was food and play
every day was just made of laughter and running around carefree because many of
the decisions were made under my parentsâ€™ guidance. As an adult, however, such
fun and joys became elusive. Responsibilities came and with that, the need to
make decisions all of which affected how I viewed life and how I lived my life.
All those decisions shaped and still shape my kind of life; my lifestyle.</p>

<p>Lifestyle
means that the way you live reflects your attitude or your values. It is not
all about money, class or health only as per the view of many. It runs deeper
to who you are, your self- image, your self-esteem and who you surround
yourself with. Your lifestyle reflects your frame of mind; whether it is
positive or negative. As human beings, we are blessed with the ability to think
and what that means is that we have the power to change our thoughts. This is
because our thoughts make us behave the way we do and shape our perspective of
life. As in the world of science, it is a cause and effect kind of thing.</p>

<p>A positive
frame of mind will make you realize that you are of value and you will
automatically find the energy to take care of yourself be it a matter of
health, finances, social life, family life or spiritual life. You will laugh
more and find that life is a journey and enjoy your evolving process. Your positive
kind lifestyle will help you handle any tough situation. Every aspect of your
life will change for the better with a positive mindset.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A negative frame of mind will negatively impact your life such that even if you can afford every comfort life offers you will find that you cannot find joy in life. Every problem will wear you down and the body responds to this by you being depressed. Your eating habits will go on a spin. You will lose the need to take care of yourself resulting in your health deteriorating. You will look older than you actually are. Your social, spiritual and family life will suffer and your lifestyle will ring nothing like healthy. That is a really sad way to live.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kind
of lifestyle you live is therefore determined by the choices you make. It
really does not matter whether you have money or not. What you speak to your
mind is powerful. The mind gives you what you feed it with. To that end, what
remains is what you want of this life. The best things in life are simple and
they are not as difficult to comprehend. Make a choice; do you want to walk
this earth gloomily like a person who is apologizing for being alive or do you
want to be a cheery pocketful of laughter and sunshine? I do hope you make the
right choice; the choice of a laughter kind of lifestyle.</p>
