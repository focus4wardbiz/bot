<p>I Remember When We Were Young, Covered With Smiles And Laughter <br> Days When We Weren't Afraid Of Bills <br> I Remember When We Were Young, When Our Best Chilling  Points Were Churches,<br>  I Don't Know What Happened After <br> Days Are Moving Really Speedy, <br> When We All Wish We Could Never Age <br> Days  When We Sat And Waited For Food Are Over <br> Our Hands Must Get Dirty, For Us To Feed <br> I Remember Moments At The River Side <br> Young And Happy We Had No Regrets <br> Trying To Cope up  With Time But Time Got Bigger Steps<br> I Can Remember My  Childhood Was Awesome <br> We Both Caught Up In This Mission That Got Many People Dying  Young <br> Nowadays We See Nothing Good We're Becoming Troublesome <br> Time Moves Fast But I Don't Know How A Day Takes Long <br> The Clock Is Moving Anticlockwise For us <br> A Generation Of Blocking And Muting Like  We're Cursed <br> I Remember We Used To Eat From Any House <br> Food Wasn't Scarce And People Were Generous <br> Everyone  To Me Was Friendly And Familiar <br> These Days I Don't See Them Near, Like Am A Killer </p>
